# UFOs

#Overview

The purpose of this project was to create a webpage of UFO sightings and key characteristics of the sighting. In specific, you can utilize the filter on the left to fill out what you are looking for and it will return a short summary. This is useful to anyone with a general interest in UFOs or someone trying to compare their findings.

#Results

Before completing a search, please reference the link:

While performing a search, you can fill out any combination of the filters. For example, if you were interested in UFOs on the 3rd of March, please type in the date as shown in the filler. After typing in '3/03/2022', you can either click out of the filter or hit enter to complete the search.

#Summary

One drawback is that the enter date filter does not look like the rest.
Two additional recommendations: change the enter date filter to match the rest and center the 'UFO Sightings...' above the body text.
